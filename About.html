	<h2>OUR CUISINES</h2>
	  <p>Chef Noor is the Founder & CEO N.eat plant-based cuisine. It was as a wide-eyed 15-year-old that Noor Temple discovered his passion for cooking. He cooked a simple sautéed chicken dish for his family, however, the joy that he saw in their faces and the accolades he received about the tastiness of the dish had him hooked. It is from that place of love that inspires each of Richard’s dishes. You might say love is the first ingredient in every dish.
Inherently curious about the cuisines of the world and with a passion for traveling, Richard has spent the years since on a culinary and literal tour of the various cuisines and countries that intrigued him. That journey started in North America, with visits to all the major food capitals of the United States, Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean. Each place had its story to tell and another dish to delight. He was especially intrigued by the cuisine of Santa Fe- New Mexico where his first foray into a formal culinary education happened at the Santa Fe School of Cooking.
His favorite place and where he gains much of his inspiration is France.  With over twenty visits to different regions of this culinary storied country, he ultimately felt the need to immerse himself in the culture and cuisine and spent a memorable month in the City of Lights, exploring markets, tasting multiple regional delicacies and replicating those foods in his Parisian apartment kitchen, much to the delight of his visiting family and friends.</p>

	<h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
	  <p>We all use type every day, from word processors and social media graphic apps to professional desktop design software and hand-coded websites. Good typography is within everyone’s reach, and it starts with the fundamentals. This module acts as an accessible primer for anyone to build confidence and skills, and is also a solid foundation for experienced designers looking to deepen their understanding of the basics.When you have some text, how can you choose a typeface? Many people—professional designers included—go through an app’s font menu until we find one we like. But the aim of this module is to show that there are many considerations that can improve our type choices. By setting some useful constraints to aid our type selection, we can also develop a critical eye for analyzing type along the way</p>
